## 1.1 What are the three main purposes of an operating system?
**Answer:** The three main purposes of an operating system are:
- **Resource Management:** Efficiently manage hardware resources like CPU, memory, and I/O devices.
- **Process Management:** Ensure proper execution of processes by managing multitasking, process scheduling, and synchronization.
- **User Interface:** Provide an interface between the user and the hardware, often through a command line or graphical user interface.

## 1.2 When is it appropriate for the operating system to forsake efficient use of computing hardware and "waste" resources? Why is such a system not really wasteful?
**Answer:** An operating system may appear to "waste" resources when focusing on user convenience and system responsiveness. For example, a GUI consumes more memory and CPU compared to a text-based interface, but it provides a more intuitive experience. Such usage isn't truly wasteful because the trade-off results in better productivity and ease of use.

## 1.3 What is the main difficulty that a programmer must overcome in writing an operating system for a real-time environment?
**Answer:** The main difficulty in writing an operating system for a real-time environment is ensuring deterministic response times. The system must handle events and complete processes within a strict deadline, which requires efficient scheduling and interrupt handling.

## 1.4 Should the operating system include applications such as web browsers and mail programs? Argue both for and against it.
**Answer:**
- **For:**
  - **Integration:** Tight integration can improve performance and security.
  - **Ease of Use:** Users have essential tools available immediately.
- **Against:**
  - **Bloat:** Adds unnecessary size and complexity.
  - **Security Risks:** Expands the systemâ€™s attack surface.

## 1.5 How does the distinction between kernel mode and user mode function as a rudimentary form of protection (security)?
**Answer:** Kernel mode and user mode help with security by creating privilege levels:
- **Kernel Mode:** Full access to hardware and system resources.
- **User Mode:** Limited access, preventing user programs from damaging the system.

## 1.6 Which of the following instructions should be privileged?
- **a. Set value of timer** - Privileged  
- **b. Read the clock** - Non-privileged  
- **c. Clear memory** - Privileged  
- **d. Issue a trap instruction** - Non-privileged  
- **e. Turn off interrupts** - Privileged  
- **f. Modify entries in device-status table** - Privileged  
- **g. Switch from user to kernel mode** - Privileged  
- **h. Access I/O device** - Privileged  

## 1.7 What are two difficulties with early memory protection schemes?
**Answer:**
- **Inflexibility:** System updates or patches required reloading the entire OS.
- **Limited Protection:** A single error could still crash the entire system.

## 1.8 What are two possible uses of multiple CPU modes?
**Answer:**
- **Enhanced Security:** Different levels of access for various system components.
- **Efficient Virtualization:** Isolation of virtual machines or user environments.

## 1.9 How could timers be used to compute the current time?
**Answer:**
- **Interrupt-driven Timer:** Updates a system clock variable at regular intervals.
- **Polling:** Queries hardware timers when needed.

## 1.10 Why are caches useful? What problems do they solve and cause? Why not make a cache as large as the device it caches?
**Answer:**
- **Benefits:** Speeds up data access, reduces latency.
- **Problems:** Consumes memory, requires consistency management.
- **Why not as large as the device:** Would defeat the purpose of fast access and create high memory consumption.

## 1.11 Distinguish between the client-server and peer-to-peer models of distributed systems.
**Answer:**
- **Client-server:** Centralized control, easier management.
- **Peer-to-peer:** Decentralized, more robust and scalable.
